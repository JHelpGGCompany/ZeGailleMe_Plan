#What is **ZeGailleMe** project ?

**ZeGailleMe** have the ambition to be several things depends on the angle we see it.

* It's a **RPG** in 3D "classic" game for **Android**.
* It's a way to show that we can do a lot of things, more than some things, with the **JVM**. 
  Here we choose **Kotlin** since it looks like the more and more used language on **Android**.
  To be coherent we will also build desktop tools in **Kotlin** for **JVM**. 
  For desktop, we will use **Swing** library includes the **JVM**, because it's powerful.
  So it will be 100% **Kotlin** for **JVM**. And in doing so, we will be able to share common tools between desktop tools 
  and **Android** game.
* It's a big tutorial, we have the ambition to explain all creation steps, architecture choices, errors (nothing is perfect), ...
* It's a challenge, does our team will be able to go through it until Android play store publication ?
